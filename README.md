# `Hey, World! Adam here...`
I am a Software Engineer & full-time Computer Science student. My "niche" is mostly DSP, simulation, and codegen/automation.

I have worked as an engineering intern at AJA Video Systems and as an Assistant for IT & Programming Instruction at CSU Chico.

I am also the former President of the Technical Projects Club & the current VP of UPE at CSU Chico.

I'm experienced in C/C++ and have written Python, JavaScript, and Various Assemblies. I have also used HDLs like Verilog.

I've created some pretty cool projects. You can view some of the notable ones in my pinned repos.
