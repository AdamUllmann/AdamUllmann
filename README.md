# `Hey, World! Adam here...`
I am a Software Engineer with a BS in Computer Science. My "niche" is realtime audio, video processing, and embedded.

I'm experienced in C/C++ and Python, and have written software in JavaScript and Various Assemblies.

I've created some pretty cool projects. You can view some of the notable ones in my pinned repos.
